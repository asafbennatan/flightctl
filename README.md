# Flight Control

> [!NOTE]
> This project is currently in beta.

Flight Control is a service for declarative management of fleets of edge devices and their workloads.

## TLS Configuration

Flight Control now supports enhanced TLS compatibility by combining system certificate authorities with custom CAs. This allows clients to connect to servers using certificates issued by either standard trusted authorities or custom certificate authorities, improving interoperability in mixed certificate environments.
